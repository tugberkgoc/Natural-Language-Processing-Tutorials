Pamuk created an actual Museum of Innocence, consisting of everyday objects tied to the narrative, and housed them at an Istanbul house he purchased. Pamuk collaborated on a documentary The Innocence Of Memories” that expanded on his Museum of Innocence. Pamuk stated that (Museum of Dreams will) tell a different version of the love story set in Istanbul through objects and Grant Gees wonderful new film”. In both Snow and the Museum of Innocence Pamuk describes tragic love-stories, where men fall in love with beautiful women at first sight. It has been noted[by whom?] that Pamuk’s portrayals of women and the reasons men fall in love with them are powerful in their intensity, yet superficial in the way these love stories originate. Pamuk’s heroes tend to be educated men who fall tragically in love with beauties, but who seem doomed to a decrepit loneliness. In 2013, Pamuk invited Grazia Toderi, whose work he admired, to design a work for the Museum of Innocence in Istanbul. Their collaboration culminated in the exhibition Words and Stars. Words and Stars opened on April 2, 2017, at the MART (Museo di Arte Moderna e Contemporanea di Trento e Rovereto), and which explores ”the inclination of man to explore space and innate vocation to question the stars.” The show was curated by Gianfranco Maraniello.[20] It also showed from November 4, 2016 to March 29, 2017 from 56 November 2016 at the Palazzo Madama, Piazza Castello, Turin, and at Infini-to, the Planetarium of Turin (Infini.to - Planetario di Torino, Museo dell’Astronomia e dello Spazio) by invitation.
